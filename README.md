# We are students of Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TARUC) and is currently pursuing my second year in Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) in Data Science. 
# In this semester, we are taking a subject called Data Science and are required to apply all the data science skills in this assignment such as data cleaning, data pre-processing, data normalisation, and data modelling. 
# Finally, we will need to choose the best model among 6 models and explain the steps of deployment.

Business Understanding
======================
In this section, we have described the backgound of the the business client (hospital), objectives, requiremetns, data mining success criteria, in ventory of resources, risk and solution.

Data Understanding
======================
In this section, we have described each of the variables in the dataset and classify them into independent and dependent variables. We have also plotted a few graphs to visualise the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. 

Data Preparation
======================
In this section, we have performed some data pre-processing job such as determining if there is any missing value, outlier and null value. Based on the dataset we have, no missing values or null values are found. However, we have identified a few outliers. To make sure that we can obtain a reliable and valid result, we clean the data by removing the outliers from the dataset. After that, we also normalise the data to make the value between 1 and 0. This step is very important so we can always get a good result.

Data Modelling
======================
In this section, we have performed the data modelling by usigng six different algorothms such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayesian (NB). The accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and Area Under Curve (AUC) are also calculated.

Evaluation
======================
In this section, we have described the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC for each of the algorithms used in data modelling.

Deployment
======================
In this section, we have identified the best model based on the precision, recall and F1-score. Besides, we have also briefly explained the steps taken to deploy the best model into Application Programming Interface (API). 

Conclusiom
======================
In this section, we have described the pros and cons of using each algorithm.

References
======================
In this section, the list of bibliographies or references are shown.
